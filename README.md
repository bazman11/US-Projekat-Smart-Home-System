# US-Projekat-Smart-Home-System
My colleagues Muris Bobić, Nail Bobić and I have been developing a prototype of a Smart Home System in the past period, for the needs of the subject "Embedded Systems". We created a system that sends data from various sensors via the WiFi network to the end user to an Android application that we designed ourselves.
